OK look

If we can make the config loading a bit more sane/uniform, then it makes it easier
to do some of the database definition.

I guess we could probably just start with a db_util thing that surfaces the database_uri?
but then where is it defined anyway?? eugh.

I am starting to hate all the reading things from the app context
